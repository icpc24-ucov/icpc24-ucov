This directory contains all the data used in the UCov paper, for the case study of 3 Java software libraries:

SparkJava
Jsoup
CommonsCli

Included are scripts used to run the experimentation, binaries of UCov to reproduce, our collected data,
library project repository snapshots, samples tests, and client information data

Due to the large size of the clients, we are not able to offer an offline copy of all clients,
but we provide the commit hash information under /library/ClientInfo for every cloned client at the time of
the experimentation.

We also include our results (SUM and SUFs and API files)
