Main   : Copy of repository from github at 48a94f1b9e0b0353642415fbfd97d5e1669c0f1b with /src/test directory removed
Tests  : Copy of repository from github at 48a94f1b9e0b0353642415fbfd97d5e1669c0f1b with /src/main directory removed
Samples: README of the repository indicates documentation available at, http://sparkjava.com/documentation as well 
         as fully featured sample classes in its readme.
         For the fully featured sample classes, we create a new java project with all of them and feed this into a
         "readme" sample project.
         For the documentation site, a tutorial section is exposed at the top of the website, at
         http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/. at the bottom of the tutorial page, is referenced at
         https://github.com/perwendel/perwendel.github.io/tree/master/_posts/tutorials, containing all user
         authored tutorials, we thus do not need to scrape the documentation, as java files are ready and usable at
         this location, we clone this into a sample directory. At the top of the tutorial page, is mentioned another
         template project, http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/application-structure, with code then linked to
         https://github.com/tipsy/spark-basic-structure. We also clone this one. This allows us to have 3 sample
         projects for Spark. We then find on the owner github account at
         https://github.com/perwendel/spark-template-engines.git, this is our fourth project
         Copy of snippets further available in README, and Website in a single project
